<font size "3" color=rgb(255,153,204)> <p><pre> In the late 1980s,</pre> Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene. <sub>They released their first album, Bleach,</sub> for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. Their sound relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to the major label DGC Records in 1990, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit", the first single from its landmark second album, Nevermind (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, Nevermind was certified diamond and is credited for ending the popularity of hair metal.[2][3][4]<p></font>
<p><U>Characterized</U> by a <Sup>punk aesthetic, Nirvana's fusion of pop melodies with noise,</Sup> combined with its themes of abjection and social alienation, brought them global popularity.

The album topped both the US and UK album charts, and was acclaimed by critics. Nirvana disbanded following Cobain's suicide in April 1994. Further releases have been overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow, Courtney Love. The live album MTV Unplugged in New York (1994) won Best Alternative Music Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards.<p>
